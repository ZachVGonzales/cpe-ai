# TODOs

## timeline

- november 20: complete perfect pipeline
- december 1: complete dataset generation
- march 13: project completion

## next steps

- [ ] set reasoning level to high
- [ ] check if the problem is very reasonable to solve with lean and if not then skip (skip the comlex geometries like simulating all points)
- [ ] batch openai calls to speed up process and make requests cheaper
- [ ] iterate through the 500 random samples from the dataset with the existing simple pipeline - goal is to see what is possible with the current setup
- [ ] improve the pipeline based on outputs from the previous step

## other goals

- [ ] try different models?
- [ ] try different system prompts?
- [ ] implement RAG / retrieval of data from knowledge base to help in lean code generation
- [ ] implement self-correction loop where the model can fix its own code based on error
